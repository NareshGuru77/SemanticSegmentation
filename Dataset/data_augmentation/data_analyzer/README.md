# Data analyzer:

* Calculates the percentage of pixels and class count of each class in the particular variant of the dataset.
* Percentage of pixels of a class = (Number of pixels occupied by the object / Total number of pixels) * 100.
* Class count of a class = number of images in which the object belonging to the class appears in.
* In addition, weight coefficients which can be used to balance the dataset could be generated.
