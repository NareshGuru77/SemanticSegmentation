[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mas-group/project-report.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mas-group/project-report)

This template is designed for the R&D and master thesis reports of the Master of Science in Autonomous Systems.  
Based on the template created by Ronni Hartanto in 2003.

The template is configured to be printed two sided by default, you can change this to your supervisor's preference by passing the option `oneside` instead.

You can add a the logo of an external institution by using the command `\thirdpartylogo{path/to/image/}`


## Usage
The main file of the report is `LastNameI-[RnD-MT]Report.tex`, please change it to match the naming convention specified by the wiki, e.g. for an R&D, John Doe would name his file `DoeJ-RnDReport.tex`.
