\chapter{Dataset creation}

\section{Overview of the dataset}
Since semantic segmentation using deep learning is framed as a pixelwise classification task, an image of dimensions H$\times$W$\times$C requires a ground truth of dimensions H$\times$W, where H and W are the height and width of the image in the dataset having C number of channels. 

The scope of the dataset is to include objects associated to RoboCup @Work. The selected 18 objects are shown in Figure \ref{Fig:objects}.

		\label{Fig:objects}
	\end{figure}

Each of the objects were taken individually, placed on 3 different backgrounds and 30 images were taken. This lead to a total of 540 images which were to be manually labeled. Since, every pixel of the images needs to be labeled, the process of manual annotation would be time consuming. Therefore, a decision was made to first annotate the 540 images and later decide whether more images could be taken based on the effort required for annotation.

Details regarding the labeling tools and the description of the labeling process can be found in appendix A. 

\section{Artificial image generation algorithm}

\subsection{Motivation}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Manually labeling 540 images with the described labeling process in appendix A takes roughly 2160 minutes (roughly 4 minutes per image). This is equivalent to around 4 working days. Hence, creating a large dataset with manual labeling is not feasible.
		\item Taking images in a variety of real world backgrounds is also time consuming.
		\item Labeling images with multiple objects would take an even longer time.
	\end{itemize}
	
These drawbacks could be overcome by randomly placing objects on a variety of different background images automatically using an algorithm.

\subsection{Process of artificial image generation}
The artificial image generation algorithm requires that every image provided must have just one object. The algorithm can be used in two modes named "Generate artificial images" and "Save visuals". The first mode can be used to generate artificial images and if required save visualizations of labels. The second mode can be used to just save visualizations. Under the first mode, the entire process can be divided into 7 broad steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1] \textbf{External interface}: An interface to obtain possible parameters to control the generation process. These parameters are obtaiend through argparse command line GUI and are called generator options.
		\item[2] \textbf{Get backgrounds and data}: Fetch all the backgrouds, images and corresponding labels from the provided respective background, image and label paths. First, all the images in the backgrounds path are read. Then, all available images in the label path is read and the corresponding image files in the provided image path is read. The images in the image path must have the same name as that of the corresponding labels but can be of a different format. The default image format is ".jpg".
		\item[3] \textbf{Get object details}: Fetch details regarding every object and its different scales. The details include information regarding object locations in an image, object values, label values, the object name, points in pixel space denoting a bounding rectangle around the object, and object area. The scales for every object is determined at random. Scaled objects which are too small or too big as determined by generator options are removed.
		\item[4] \textbf{Generate augmenter list}: Every element in the augmenter list denotes an artificial image and contains information including the chosen background image, the number of objects to place in the artificial image, which objects from the object details list are selected and locations in pixel space where the selected objects need to be placed. In this stage, elements which are cluttered with too many objects are removed as determined by the generator options.
		\item[5] \textbf{Generate artificial images}: Based on every element in the augmenter list, artificial images and corresponding labels are generated. Every element is taken one by one. The selected objects are placed on the selected background in the corresponding specified location, one by one. The resultant artificial image and semantic label is saved in the directory specified using generator options. Additionally, object detection labels, semantic masks and visualization previews can be saved by configuring generator options.
		\item[6] \textbf{Visualize results}: The generated images and labels are visualized to verify the generation process.
		\item[7] \textbf{Save results}: The obtained resultant artificial images, corresponding labels and generated visualizations are saved.
	\end{itemize}
	
Under the second mode, steps 3 to 6 in the above process is skipped. Step 2 fetches also the object detection labels in addition to the image and semantic labels. Step 7 saves the visualizations of read image, semantic labels and object detection labels.
		

\subsection{Generator options}

A number of arguments can be configured to control the generation process. Configuration of generator options is possible through command line GUI. Description of the generator options is provided in Table \ref{Table:godes} and further details can be found in appendix A.

\subsection{Sample results}
Sample results of the artificial image generation algorithm can be seen in Figure \ref{Fig:sample}. These images are generated using different backgrounds and hence the dataset is referred to as variety of backgrounds dataset. The bounding box in the label visualization image represents the object detection label and the different colors of the segmentation labels denote different label values. The colors were chosen in such a way that they are as distinct from each other as possible \cite{simple_colors}.

At the top of every label visualization image, the objects in the image and their corresponding colors in the visualization are indicated.}
		\label{Fig:sample}
	\end{figure}
	
\subsection{Downloading background images}
Different background images were used for the artificial image generation process. Since a large number of backgrounds were required, manual download was time consuming. Hence, the "google-images-download" \cite{image_downloader} script was used to auto download images. The search keywords used to obtain the background images are listed in appendix A. From the downloaded images, the required number of images for each dataset split were selected. For the white backgrounds dataset, many different search keywords were tried. This was because many of the downloaded images did not contain sufficient white regions. Images which were not of the dimensions used in the dataset (480$\times$640) were rescaled.

	
\subsection{Notable features of the artificial image generator}

In this section, certain features of the artificial image generator which are noteworthy are listed.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The generator automatically creates object detection labels in addition to semantic labels. The object detection labels are obtained by finding the rectangle points which describe a bounding rectangle around the semantic labels.
		\item The generated artificial images and labels can be visualized in three different ways. A preview which shows the image alongside the generated labels. A mask image showing the different classes in different colors. An overlay image in which the generated labels are overlayed on top of the corresponding generated images. The opacity of overlay can be configured through generator options. Examples of visualizations can be seen in Figure \ref{Fig:visuals} and in Figure \ref{Fig:sample}.

		\label{Fig:visuals}
		\end{figure}
		
	\end{itemize}
	
\subsection{Artificial images for each dataset split}

The real images are split into training, validation and test sets. Real images in each of these sets are used to generate artificial images for the coresponding set. This ensures that the final training, validation and test sets are different from each other. The default scale range of [0.24, 1.2] is retained for all objects except for the "distance\_tube". The scale range of "distance\_tube" was set to [1.1, 2.0] for generating training artificial images and to [0.6, 1.2] for generating validation and test artificial images. This is because the lower limit of 0.24 in the default scale range zooms down "distance\_tube" in a manner that it is no longer perceivable which is not desired.

\section{Creation of dataset variants}
Different variants of the dataset are created based on the properties of the objects in the dataset, and the type of  background images used for generation of artificial images.
	\subsection{Motivation}
		Looking into the objects present in the dataset, it is apparent that some objects are similar in certain aspects. For instance, the objects m20 and m30 are very similar to each other except that m30 is bigger in size and has a slightly different color. Because of the similarities existing among objects, the segmentation model could face certain difficulties as listed below:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Inability to distinguish size}: The segmentation model is given no information regarding the positions of the camera or the object in the real world. If camera extrinsic calibration information is available to the segmentation model, the model could possibly learn to distinguish different sizes. However, such information is not available. In addition, the objects in the artificial images are randomly scaled to different sizes thereby removing any size related information available.
			\item \textbf{Inability to distinguish subtle variations in color}: The real images were taken under different lighting conditions. As a result, there is no consistent difference in color information available between classes. This makes it difficult for the segmentation model to learn patterns in color information.
			\item \textbf{Inability to distinguish shapes}: Certain objects are closly related to each other in terms of shape and differ only slightly. For instance, bearing\_box\_ax16 and bearing\_box\_ax01 are similar in shape except in a few viewpoints as illustrated in Figure \ref{Fig:sim1} and in Figure \ref{Fig:sim2}. In such cases, in certain viewpoints, the segmentation model would not be able to distinguish between similarly shaped objects.

	\caption{A similar viewpoint of bearing box ax01 and bearing box ax16 where they appear similar in shape.}
	\label{Fig:sim2}
\end{figure}	
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Dataset variants}
	
	Four different dataset variants have been created as listed below:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{atWork\_full}: This variant has different label values for all the 18 objects in the dataset and an additional label value for background. The total number of classes is 19 including background and the label values range from 0 to 18. The different classes in this variant along with their label values are listed in Table \ref{Table:variants}.
		\item \textbf{atWork\_size\_invariant}: In this variant, objects which are similar to each other in terms of shape but differ in size are combined together into one class. On this regard, f20\_20\_B and s40\_40\_B are combined and named f\_s20\_40\_20\_40\_B. Similarly, f20\_20\_G and s40\_40\_G are combined and named f\_s20\_40\_20\_40\_G. m20 and m30 are combined and named m20\_30. The two bearing boxes, bearing\_box\_ax01 and bearing\_box\_ax16 are also combined together as they are similar to each other in certain viewpoints. They form the new class bearing\_box. The objects in this variant along with their label values are listed in Table \ref{Table:variants}. This variant is named "atWork\_size\_invariant" as in this variant, the major change deals with the ignorance of the size of the objects as distinguishing information.
		\item \textbf{atWork\_similar\_shapes}: In the previous variant "atWork\_size\_invariant", objects similar in terms of shape but different in terms of color were treated as separate classes. In this variant, variation in terms of color is also ignored. In addition to the previous variant, f\_s20\_40\_20\_40\_B and f\_s20\_40\_20\_40\_G are combined and named f\_s20\_40\_20\_40\_B\_G. The container boxes, container\_box\_red and container\_box\_blue were also combined to form the new class container\_box. This variant is named "atWork\_similar\_shapes" as objects with similar shapes are given equal label values. Details regarding this variant are listed in Table \ref{Table:variants}.
		\item \textbf{atWork\_binary}: An interesting question would be, "how would a segmentation model perform when it is just tasked with segmenting foreground from background". To address this question, an additional variant is created called "atWork\_binary" where are the objects of interest are combined to form the "foreground" class with label value 1. The "background" class retains its label value of 0. The classes in this variant are listed in Table \ref{Table:variants}.
		
		\begin{table}[h]

			\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}

  			\makecell{Label \\Value} & \makecell{atWork\_\\full \\ objects} & \makecell{atWork\_size\_\\invariant \\ objects} & \makecell{atWork\_similar\_\\shapes \\ objects} & \makecell{atWork\_\\binary \\ objects} \\

			\hline
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{This table lists the objects in each variant and its corresponding label value.} 
			\label{Table:variants}
		\end{table}
		
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{White backgrounds dataset}
The backgrounds used for the artificial image generation process are images with a variety of different colors, textures and so on. In essense, the background images do not seem to follow any pattern as such. As a result, the generated artificial images are unlikely to be similar to an image taken by an atWork robot. In order to address this, the background images used in the artificial image generation process are all replaced with images which mostly contain shades of white color in them. With this as the only change, the entire artificial image generation process and variant creation process is repeated to arrive at a new dataset which is named "white backgrounds dataset". Sample visualizations of artificial images generated for this dataset can be seen in Figure \ref{Fig:samplewhite}.

\section{Data analysis}
\label{section:analysis}

\textbf{[Incomplete]}
	All the variants of the dataset are analyzed in terms of the pixels occupied by each class in percentage and the number of images in which each class appears. 
	
	\subsection{Surface area of the objects}
		
		In order to comprehend the reasons as to why an object constitutes a certain percentage of pixels in a dataset split, the surface area of the objects in the real world could be considered. It is natural to assume that the percentage of pixels occupied by the objects is roughly proportional to the surface area of the object. However, not all objects have a strictly defined geometric shape. For this reason, the closest geometric shape to each object is assumed to calculate the surface area. The table provides details about the assumed geometric shapes and the surface areas for each object.

	\subsection{Percentage of pixels and class count}
		
	\subsubsection{atWork\_full variant}
		The total pixels occupied by each class in each of the training, validation and test sets is calculated. Next, this count of pixels is converted to percentage with respect to the total number of pixels in the corresponding dataset split. Also, the number of images in which each class of objects appears is counted and called class count. The resulting plots are shown in \ref{Fig:ana_full_b} and \ref{Fig:ana_full}. In \ref{Fig:ana_full_b}, it is evident that compared to the background class, the object classes occupy almost negligible pixel area. This is desired as the background class is present in all images and in most of them, occupies the most pixel area. The larger object classes occupy the most pixel area as can be seen in \ref{Fig:ana_full}. However, in terms of class count all objects are fairly close to each other. A direct reason is infact that larger size occupies more pixel area. Indirectly however, the larger objects are less likely to be rejected by the artificial image generation algorithm after being randomly scaled. This again leads to increased pixel area occupied by the larger objects.

\section{Meta-data of the dataset}

Meta-data of the dataset is provided in Table \ref{Table:meta}. These numbers hold true for all four dataset variants and also for the shades of white dataset. Initially, 30 images were captured for each of the 18 objects leading to a total of 540 images. However, 1 image of "axis" object and 2 images of "s40\_40\_B" were removed as they were blurred.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
	\hline 
    & Training & Validation & Test \\ 
	\hline 
	Real Images & \makecell{22 per object.\\ Total: 22$\times$18=396} & \makecell{4 per object.\\ Total: 4$\times$18=72} & 				\makecell{"axis"=3; \\"s40\_40\_B"=2; \\All other objects=4\\ Total: (4$\times$18)-3=69} \\ 
	\hline 
	Artificial Images & 7104 & 870 & 870 \\ 
	\hline 
	Total Images & 7500 & 942 & 939 \\ 
	\hline 
	\end{tabular}

\section{Possible directions of improvement}

Creating a custom dataset for a desired application is evidently challenging. To overcome the time consuming nature of creating annotations for semantic segmentation, choices such as 1. placing just 1 object per image while taking real images and 2. augmenting the objects on a random selection of diverse backgrounds, were made. This method of augmentation, although inspired by dataset generation method used in \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1709-00849} and the Synthia dataset \cite{RosCVPR16}, takes a different approach. Unlike \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1709-00849}, which uses 3D CAD models, this approach does not require any 3D models. Also, this approach does not require a virtual world as used by the Synthia dataset \cite{RosCVPR16}. 
The following list provides possible directions of improvement:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The ImageLabeler app by default saves the label '.png' file with the name 'Label\_1.png' in a folder called PixelLabelData. A automation script can be written and added to the ImageLabeler to provide options to save the label file in a way the user wants.
		\item Creating a way to replace all unlabeled pixels with the label value of 'background' from within the ImageLabeler would be helpful. For now, this is done by first exporting the label, then loading the label using opencv in python to replace 0 (value of unlabeled pixels) with 19 (value of 'background').
		\item The artificial image generation algorithm is written in python and is independent of the MATLAB ImageLabeler app. This can be improved by including a way to start artificial image generation right from the ImageLabeler.
	\end{itemize}
